If you are looking for specific music recommendation-patterns or try to circumnavigate situations, in which the algorithm is stuck in a direction you dont want to go in, you are out of luck under the current system.I suggest implementing a UI that allows users to adjust the statistical model of the algorithm. I have two primary options in mind:1. Focus Width from narrow to broad2. Number of neighbours from high to lowBy focus width I mean the statistical deviance the algorithm is set to. A lower value would lead to results that stay closer to the source material (Genre, artist, other songs listeners like) and a higher value would lead to more variety but less correlation with the source-data.By number of neighbours I mean the number of songs in for example a playlist that are accounted for to recommend a song. A lower value would mean that a smaller set of songs leads to any individual recommended song, which produces songs that closely match each just a few source-songs. A higher value would take a larger set of songs into account for any single recommendation.There are two more related options I would like to propose:1. Change direction2. Forget timeframeChange direction is similar to reload under playlist recommendations but doesnt just load a new batch, but also changes the source-parameters taken from the playlist a bit, to yield different resultsForget timeframe is quite self-explanatory and is just an option to not take listening-behavior from a set timeframe into account anymore. This allows users to listen to music they dont want recommendations for without having to remember to activate a private session. It also allows user to act retroactively.At last I want to recommend an option to import a friends algorithm settings, if they share it with you, so you can change to their algorithm in the settings and experience the recommendations as they do.',\n",

The update has totally ruined my experience on Spotify.  It is a classic example of graphic designers and visual artists changing things with NO REGARD for how their tweaks will effect the actual USER experience. My main concern is that I appear to have lost almost my entire list of saved artists. I used to save songs and because that would automatically add artists to my library, I would then browse my library EXCLUSIVELY by artist.  When I go to \"artists\" in the new UI, I have about 5 artists saved under the letter \"A\". I used to have upwards of 30. The same goes for every letter of the alphabet. The artists that were migrated into my \"new\" library are only the artists I follow. The complete list (of hundreds of artists) is shown below the \"followed\" artists, and IT IS NOT IN ALPHA ORDER . WHAT COMPLETE FOOL DECIDED THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?  MOST of the artists that I have songs saved for are now listed SEPARATELY from the ones that I \"follow\" If there is not a quick fix to recover my library, you can consider my subscription over and I will be switching to Apple Music, because I still have an iMac and an iPod. Please tell me I can recover my library in alphabetical order. Just because I haven\\'t heard a song in a month does not mean I want it to be **bleep** near impossible to find.

Albums will finally sound like albums again. IN THE FUTURE - When you select \"set the same volume for all albums\" then it should also read the metadata in your personal music files (when the tag is present). The Name of this tag in my mp3 and flac collection is \"REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN\". \"Set The Same Volume Level For All Tracks\" - (replaygain track mode) BEST FOR SHUFFLE MODE, OR LISTENING TO LOTS OF RANDOM SONGS)Spotify already has \"Set the same volume level for all tracks\" in settings for songs that are streamed, which is the equivalent to replaygain track mode. This currently only works for streamed songs and it doesn\\'t check to see if the tag \"REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN\" is present in your local audio file that you\\'re currently listening to, a very simple fix indeed.  DISABLED MODE = NOTHING TICKED.When unticking \"set the same volume for all albums\" and \"set the same volume for all tracks\", all streamed and local music should not play with any volume adjustment on either streamed or library tracks, it is exactly the same effect as disabling \"set the same volume for all tracks\" that we currently have. There are many reasons for needing to turn of volume normalization (such as troubleshooting volume problems etc). Replaygain volume adjustments should be fully lossless when your dac is 24 bit.Note to spotify - By using metadata, this should be totally seamless - E.g. If the exact same album is streamed, then local files should play at precisely the same volume as streamed files. IF EITHER TAG IS MISSING FROM METADATA - \"REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN\" or \"REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN\" then spotify should not make any volume adjustment and it should produce the same result as having album mode or track mode not TICKED.When installing spotify, the default should still be set to \"set same volume for all tracks\" like it it just now ',\n",

       " \"Dear Spotify, As someone who cares about the quality of the music they listen to, and spends a decent amount of money on a worthy setup, it's important to me to have a lossless source. Until I purchased a system worthy enough of Hi-Fi quality music, I was using Spotify for many years and sound quality was satisfactory for the hardware I was running and the user experience was second to none.  Step into 2018 where Hi-Fi quality audio is becoming more and more important to many people, who spend £££'s on DAC's and high end headphones and ££££'s on high-end home audio equipment. With streaming just being the most convenient way to listen to music, here is what us audiophiles have as options: 1) A CD player with hundreds of CD's2) A NAS device with loads of ripped CD's3) Record player with everything on vinyl4) A high resolution streaming service such as Tidal, Deezer or Qobuz. 1) and 2) are just not convenient enough options anymore. 3) will always have a place in the lives of many audiophiles but is not ideal for casual listening. So we are left with 4). I opted for Tidal out the streaming services which sits behind Roon so I can control my whole setup remotely from my iPad, whilst still maintaining a lossless source. This is incredibly painful, Tidal's algorithms for finding related music is not a touch on yours, and it's very bias towards the hip-hop. Roon has a great wireless protocol for lossless transmission which really needs to be heard to be believed but it's interface sits on top of Tidals and is not the nicest user experience to find music. Tidal has 3.5million subscribers, 45% of which are subscribed to the Hi-Fi service. Plus everyone subscribed to Deezer and Qobuz and that's a hefty market share you could quite literally grab overnight if you released a Hi-Fi service. You could charge £20 per month for this premium service just as Tidal does and you would receive millions of new (and rejoining) subscribers in a matter of days. For the sake of the audiophile community who desperately want this, can you please provide an update to the following questions: 1) Is Spotify Hi-Fi something that's going to happen?2) If so, roughly what timelines are we looking at?3) What technical challenges are preventing or delaying this from happening?4) Is there a beta some users can sign up to? Or are people just adding their names to another thread in vein? I would, along with all others who care about the quality of their music and want Spotify back in their lives, appreciate answers to the above.  Thanks ps.

I tried several ways to try to avoid this, by clicking dislike button whenever a song from other language is played. But I just couldn't change this behavior. This is happening for Daily Mix, Discover Weekly as well. I'm mostly spending time skipping all these songs that I don't listen to.

       " 'The Problem:  I listen to very different music while doing very different things throughout my day and night, and this causes my Spotify algorithm to generate muddy, unhelpful recommendations. Here are examples of this problem:  I have small children, and occasionally want to play them children\\'s music. Listening to this music impacts my algorithm, and causes me to start seeing children\\'s music as a recommendation. I do not personally listen to children\\'s music, and this is causing a negative user experience for me when I want to listen to something for myself.I put on specific playlists while sleeping - ambient/classical type stuff. I ONLY want to hear this while I\\'m trying to rest. Listening to this (and for as many hours as I do) significantly impacts my algorithm, and causes me to start seeing ambient/sleepy music when I am trying to find things to listen to while awake. This is creating a very negative user experience for me - it is massively frustrating finding music to listen to when I don\\'t want to fall asleep.I put on specific playlists/artists while I am at work. Again, I only want to hear this stuff when I\\'m trying to concentrate on a task. Listening to this all day impacts my algorithm, and causes me to start seeing this kind of music recommended, again negatively impacting my user experience. The Solution: As a user, I should be able to custom create a few broad \"listening modes\" for myself. Examples (for me) might be \"Kids Mode\", \"Sleep Mode\", \"Work Mode\", \"Fun Mode\" and perhaps \"Exercise Mode\". These are my examples - each user should be in control of their own custom \"modes\". From the app\\'s home screen, I should then be able to toggle into one of my  \"modes\". Only one \"mode\" should be active at any time. With a \"mode\" activated, anything I listen to should ONLY affect recommendations I see while I am in that particular \"mode\". This would stop me having to wade through kids\\' music and sleep music when I\\'m trying to put on music to entertain guests. Just for example.',\n",

This can happen due to several reasons. If you believe that your music recommendations are not accurate because someone else has gained access to your account, I'd recommend checking out this support article for the next steps to take. However, if you think that Spotify's recommendations just aren't accurate, I suggest you listen to all of your favorite tunes so you're recommended music similar to the music you like. On another note, keep in mind that anything you listen to in a private session may not influence your music recommendations.

I only have 700 songs in my playlist and I know the rap/hip-hop/classical/rock world is larger than that.I would like to propose a widget, or setting that can be manipulated that changes the way the algorithm looks for recommended songs.For example: allowing us to filter them by song title, so even if an artist re-uploads their song and the URI/metadata changes, the title will still help with the filtering.How many times they've already been displayed in the recommended section, based on a timestamp.  I have seen some songs appear 3 times in 4 refreshes, within 15-20 seconds of each other.Sometimes having an algorithm do everything for us can decrease an app's quality. Having options on how the refreshes fetch songs could make discovering new music much better and improve Spotify.  Heck.

Limitations of the recommendation APIThen, I found out the Spotify Recommendation API which seemed to be the ideal solution to my problem. However, the first problem I faced was the seed limitation (amount of tracks or artist I can input to generate recommendations) which is limited to 5, so I will not be able to use this API on X users * their top tracks. I then received a solution proposed by @murraypaul :   Make multiple calls to the recommendations query with different random permutations of 5 of your 10 tracks, and build up a result out of the tracks that are recommended the most times.   which seems a very good idea to obtain \"quite acceptable\" recommendations but when I dug into this path I could also read from @kkhal that:   When I started working with the recommendations API I thought the same but I don\\'t think that this would give very good results. As far as I can tell the recommendations API doesn\\'t combine your seeds to come up with tracks that best meet a mixture of the seeds. If you have multiple seeds it just returns some recommendations relevant to each one.- if you have 1 seed, you get 20 recommendations based on that seed- if you have 2 seeds, you get about 10 recommendations based on each seedFor example, if I have 2 genre seeds: rock and soundtracks, I don\\'t get rock music soundtracks. I get 10 recommendations of rock and 10 of (mostly orchestral) soundtracks. I\\'d love to think it\\'s cleverer than that but, based on this example, I doubt it.    So I concluded that the recommendation API was still very valuable for my use case but not in the way I thought it will be.

And that\\'s where I need your valuable help 🙃. [A] Mixed recommendations:This first solution is the easiest one to achieve but also the less accurate one. It consists of generating recommendations for each user and then choose random tracks from all recommendations (or generating recommendations based on random tracks from random users).

       " 'I’ve had Spotify for a couple of years and have never had any major issues I felt needed to be addressed until January of this year. Since then each update has brought nothing but frustration, and this latest update takes the cake. My first guess is they’re under new management and they’re trying to justify their paycheck and make their mark. What the heck was wrong with the old layout? Nothing! This update that was shoved down my throat today is absolutely terrible.                First off, there’s the obvious and unnecessary aesthetic changes. I hate how large the buttons on the Your Library page have become. It is needless and annoying. The last list size was perfect, not too big that it took forever to scroll through and not too small that you couldn’t see it from a distance. I liked having the list of Your Daily Mix, Playlist, Stations, Songs, Albums, Artists, and Podcasts on the Your Library page with Recently Played underneath.                Secondly, Recently Played is awful. I used to live off of that on my home page. I tend to cycle through a chunk of my music, but now Recently Played is gone from the Your Library page and they have just two sections for Artists and “Albums. Recently Played is no longer a convenient tap away. Instead, it is on the Home page and you have to scroll through large pictures to see what you have, which you can only see about two or two and a half of at a time. No longer a quick tap, which is way more dangerous if you’re driving.My third complaint is the Artist/Albums pages that are set up in Your Library. Instead, the first few artists under “Recommended Artists ” are my recently played artists, but after that it just suggests artists that I have in my library that I’m seriously not interested in listening to. If I was wanting something different, I would have gone through and actually looked for them on my own.My biggest complaint is how Spotify is now forcing you to download everything from every album you’ve saved even a single song from. I very rarely find an artist that has a large selection of music I enjoy; thus, I only save between 1 and 10 songs per artist, with a handful of exceptions. For a month or so now I couldn’t listen to an album (online) because it would make me listen to the whole album and not just the 3 songs I downloaded. That was frustrating enough, but I found a doable loophole. Just listen to the artist; that only listed the songs I saved. If I was in the mood to listen to just the songs from one album then I was **bleep**, but at least I wasn’t getting the 20 other trash songs on an album I wasn’t a big fan of. This “update” fixed that loophole. And by “fixed”, I mean they fixed it so that it doesn’t work anymore. I opened Spotify to find that that I had a few hundred songs downloading and all my sorting work was ruined.Seriously. If I liked the songs I would have downloaded them in the first place. I don’t want that much space on my phone taken up by songs that I do not enjoy. It defeats the purpose of saving things to your library. There are no options to remove or block the excess songs from your library. But one of my fears is now that these songs are downloaded into my library that means if they do ever “fix” this problem then I have to go back through all my artists and albums and remove everything I have already sorted.The fifth complaint I have is that I can no longer scroll through artists and albums alphabetically. I can’t sort by recently added for the artist or the album, either. I really liked that option to sort by recently added albums. But the quick scroll was great and now it’s gone. I often don’t remember the artist/album name or how to spell it correctly. An example of this would be as follows: (there’s also a bit of glitch I noticed recently that took place before this update that I want to complain about) I went to search through my artist library list for “Cécile Corbel”, but she did not appear in my artist library. Only when I physically typed in her name in the artist library search bar (thank goodness for YouTube recommendations that helped me remember her name and spelling) that she showed up in my library. Even with this newest update she doesn’t show up in my artist library list unless I’ve recently played her. It makes me concerned about how many other small artists I’ve saved that I cannot see when scrolling through the library.After that, you now have to “add” artist to your library… again. The list under “recommended” consists of artists that you’ve saved, but the FOLLOW button is right there beside the artists. Again, I don’t like most music by most of the artists in my library, so I don’t want to follow them. But back to the “Add artists” button… once you add an artist it really seems like you can’t remove them, and it’s so easy to accidentally hit the wrong artist in that little drop down menu they have. Also, what’s with the “Liked Songs” playlist that was shoved into my library? I had to quickly cancel that ridiculous download. How do you just like a song without downloading/saving it to your library and vice versa? I already can’t remove songs I dislike (which I now have a lot of).Now for my other complaints about Spotify that are not related to the latest “update” (I quote update because it’s terrible and it didn’t actually show an update in the App store. It just sort of happened). First off, they seem to have cancelled my student premium subscription (I get it. It needs updating, it’s been a year) but I cannot change my email. It reverted back to an old email I no longer use, but when I hit “Edit Profile” it will not let me change my email, so I can’t enter my student email in and it’s not recognizing me as a student. Secondly, turning in complaints or even searching through complaints is convoluted. They make you go through a bunch of steps, links and pages to post a complaint. I don’t fancy deleting everything and reinstalling the app every time I have a problem which is what they seem to think will solve every problem.To put all this simply, Spotify is now terrible, forces you to download everything whether or not you have space on your phone, you can’t easily scroll or sort through your library, and they’re hiding some of my artists. They really need to stop trying to fix what’s not broken. I get wanting/needing to polish up the designs and layouts a bit to keep the new and shiny look, but this is ridiculous. They need to bring back the original look. If Spotify really wants to make convenient changes then make the home page more customizable. For example, the ability to remove or rearrange the options in Your Library. It would have also been nice to be able to sort saved songs by alphabetical order or by artist instead of just what was recently added. They can still have a recommended songs/artists/playlists section (which I believe they had before under Browse?), just don’t shove it down my throat. It seems like Spotify is trying to make everything more complicated but reduce the number of sections and buttons.My long-time affinity for Spotify is jaded and I’m seriously considering other music streaming service options for the first time ever. I never liked Apple because I don’t like iCloud and it forces everyone in your family to have all the same music, but at this point it seems better than what Spotify is offering. Thank you for the good times, Spotify, but I’m sick of this **bleep**. Whoever has been directing your updates this past year needs to be sacked. Spotify ought to hire on some people to test any of these major changes they’re wanting to make before they go publishing it. Maybe like a beta tester for a video game? They wouldn’t need to be paid much, maybe just offered premium for free for X amount of time in exchange for honest reviews of the product and updates. But I don’t have much hope, because Spotify rarely seems to listen to customer reviews.PlanPremiumCountryUSADevice(iPhone 6s)Operating SystemiOS 12.2My Question or IssueSpotify needs new management.',\n",

       " 'Existing recommender systems are limited in the ability to help us grow and understand our personal music preferencesRecommender systems are ubiquitous and influence the information we consume daily by helping us navigate vast catalogs of information like music databases. However, they mostly take a linear approach of surfacing content in ranked lists (such as playlists), without showing any context such as how the artists are related or what the sub-genre of each track is. This limits their ability to help us grow and understand our personal preferences. What if we had a way to visualize that information and explore music more actively while sparking exciting discoveries? This is just an early exploratory idea, but it might have implications on how we at Spotify help people discover new music, or how we support the editors that create our special playlists.\\u2003To better understand how users explore and understand the music genres they listen to, and how we can better support them in their exploration processes, we developed TastePaths: an interactive web tool that helps users explore an overview of the genre-space via a graph of connected artists. How can we best help music listeners explore a novel music space? Let’s ask the expertsTo learn how it is best to explore a novel genre, we started our research by interviewing five music curators at Spotify who delve into new genres and figure out what is necessary to learn about a genre on a daily basis. This helped us identify three main findings that we turned into our design goals:In order to give users a meaningful starting point for exploring a genre, we should help anchor them with artists they already know and listen to.In order to contextualize the genre and help users understand it and its components, we should present an overview depicting the genre-space and its subgenres.In order to allow users to easily assess what parts of the genre they like, we should have a quick and convenient way to deep-dive into an artist’s work while being able to seamlessly go back to exploring.Incorporating what we learned from the experts into the design and implementation of TastePathsBy leveraging Spotify’s Web API, as well as a custom version created by Paul Lamere, TastePaths generates a force-directed graph of 150 related artists and assists the user in exploring and making sense of it. TastePaths helps a user explore a genre by basing exploration to three of their most frequently listened to artists in that genre (“anchor artists”, which appear as black dots in the graph). To help users make sense of all the nodes, TastePaths then clusters the artists and presents a legend, displaying each cluster’s three most representative sub-genres. Users can listen to the artist’s tracks by hovering their mouse over the nodes, and they can also add them to a playlist.\\u2003What do real Spotify users think of TastePath’s visual interface? In the second part of our research, we explored how real users interacted with the TastePaths system. We recruited 16 participants from the dscout (ages 19 to 53), from diverse backgrounds. To be eligible for the study, they had to have a Spotify premium account, be interested in exploring new music, and listen to discovery-focused playlists (Discover Weekly & Release Radar) at least once in the last three months. Through our analysis, we identified four main themes: (1) personalization is key, (2) best discoveries are between or on the edge of genres, (3) users want more control: human-in-the-loop growing and pruning of the graph, (4) improved recommendation explainability through mental map.Theme 1: Personalization is keyIn regards to our research question about the role of personalization in open-exploration, we found that personalization is key. Participants were on average more interested in exploring the personalized version of TastePaths and felt they more easily discovered new artists. Finally, users wanted even more personalization. They wanted more of their past listening data reflected in the network. Multiple users expressed interest in a heat-map feature that would help them prioritize clusters to explore.Theme 2: Best discoveries are between or on the edge of genresWe were also interested in what strategies users might employ when removing the linear constraints. We found that participants encountered their best discoveries in between or on the edge of genres. Artists in between two genres captured essences of two musical styles, which led to exciting discoveries. Meanwhile, artists on the edge of a cluster would often be lesser-known and contain interesting deep-cuts in a sub-genre. Theme 3: Users want more control: human-in-the-loop growing and pruning of the graphUsers also expressed interest in more control, desiring to grow the network where they found music they enjoyed and prune portions they found less interesting. They also imagined an adaptive version of the guide, where the path would change as they provided feedback on artists. Theme 4: Improved recommendation explainability through mental map We found that using TastePaths helps users understand the variance of music within a genre, what they liked and disliked in a genre, as well as the vocabulary to describe their interests. This new knowledge helped them feel better equipped to understand where their recommendations were coming from. And beyond this new knowledge of sub-genres, users also wanted to learn more, including the history of the genre, its sonic characteristics, and influential artists. What does this mean for future recommender systems?Our study highlights a few important points for discussion. First of all, we see the need for more expressive and natural feedback from users so that they can tailor how the system represents and understands their interests. By enabling expressive feedback, we can better inform the algorithms powering popular recommendation systems. One finding from our user study was that particularly rich and interesting discoveries would lie either between two clusters or on the edge of a cluster. This information could be used as implicit feedback to generate discovery playlists to enable further exploration with minimal effort. Additionally, while people used TastePaths to explore their interests more deeply, they also really liked that it was a finite list of nodes, which gave them a sense of closure (unlike an endless feed of media content). One way to further support user agency in their consumption could be to help them form goals on how far or how long to explore during the session to encourage growth and agency as opposed to longer listening sessions.Overall, we created TastePaths as an interactive web tool that helps users deeply explore and understand the music genres they listen to. Future tools in this space can investigate how to better incorporate learning into exploratory search, how to incorporate more closure and goal-fulfillment in recommendation systems, and how to support users in modifying the system’s representation of their taste and interests. We would like to thank all of the curators and music editors who helped us with their feedback and insights about the tool!More details about this work can be found in our paper:TastePaths: Enabling Deeper Exploration and Understanding of Personal Preferences in Recommender SystemsSavvas Petridis, Nediyana Daskalova, Sarah Mennicken, Samuel F Way, Paul Lamere, and Jennifer ThomIUI 2022 geovanebentoSpotify StarHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".If you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.Note: I\\'m not a Spotify employee.',\n",

I tried everything, removing / reinstalling Spotify, using a different device, signing out and signing in, I don't know what's left for me to do!

       " ' Lately in my mixes (READ: The only music I can only play on my phone for FREE) Spotify thinks I listen to garbage. At least it knows I like classical music, folk, classic rock, soundtracks, and new age/jazz/blues. The Daily Drive is supposed to be full of some of your favorite songs to motivate you through the day. Luckily I am able to omit podcasts, but I guess Spotify thinks polluting a little more than half my feed with unlistenable garbage is a-okay. Not even the Favorites Playlist is safe! See that heart down there, Spotify? See it?! See how it’s not green?! That means I have not hearted the song!!! So why is it playing?! Guess ‘Swift’ starts with the same letter as ‘Shostakovitch’ and ‘Sibelius’, I suppose. This problem also crops up in a few other playlists and mixes as well. So what is going on here? Why is Spotify playing popular music that I absolutely hate? It should be recommending me music I would LIKE to listen to, not what would be POPULAR. I have a few theories:Spotify is astroturfing artists by making their songs play no matter what you listen to, making them look more ‘popular’ than in reality.Spotify believes that ‘getting out of your comfort zone’ and ‘deliberately making yourself feel uncomfortable’ are somehow one and the same.Playing irrelevant artists on free accounts will likely make the listener skip them. Give them enough songs in one sitting, then they will have no more skips. This will then prompt them to get Premium.But does anyone really know of any ways I can stop this madness? I would like some good answers! ',\n",

Why would I bother trying to navigate that?  So I have to ask, how can I easily discover high quality and relevant playlists of friends, or find new friends on Spotify?  My suggestions are for Spotify to1) recommend other listeners to me as friend recs2) add to the friend profile page # of songs per playlist (not just # of follows), and allow more info about the person, some kind of actual page, stop relying on Facebook, it\\'s not a music site3) allow playlist ratings and categories (including public and private) and maybe feed this into the friend rec algorithm4) maybe reveal more info about why and how the friend rec algorithm chooses its recommended friends (e.g. this user is a highly rated playlist creator in jazz) Spotify uses the most advanced algorithms to recommend songs, albums and artists, belonging to static historical genres, based on listening history.  It\\'s a completely backwards looking philosophy.  I\\'m interested in art, not coloring books where the lines are already drawn and the new \"artist\" fills it in with a new arrangement of color.  What I\\'m saying is listeners are not static, they are dynamic and human.  Tastes have to be allowed to change.  Art needs to be free to change without trying to sound like something else from the past to gain popularity. What I\\'m suggesting is a feature to recommend other friends/fans/listeners that have 1) similar listening and/or playlist tastes and/or 2) some credibility as playlist creators, maybe a large number of follows or good playlist ratings.  How they obtain that many follows currently is a total mystery to me looking strictly at the Spotify app, maybe on Facebook?  Sorry I don\\'t use it and when I did, the conversations were not about music.  The real idea is to give the music discovery control to humans, to improve networking as music fans and find new music by following many other similar fans who I don\\'t know from Facebook or real life.  These fans, at least starting out, are similar, but since they are human are free to change and influence my tastes through this change.  Important:  I need the tastes of who I follow to be much more visible to me, improved Spotify profile pages and friend rec algorithms.

I think 2 other buttons should be added to this list: the regular \"Back\" button, and an \"Add Song to Playlist\" button. This matches how I explore recommendations: if I hear a song I think has potential, I may relisten to it, and then (tentatively) add it into my playlist for further listening.

I’ve been wondering for a while if there is a way for me to customize the recommendations I get in a way where I can choose the countries or continents I’m interested in getting information about. I am Latin American, and I live in Australia, and however much I enjoy pop and rock releases from this side of the world, UK and USA, I want to actually get information about the music being released in my country and in Central and South America in general. I’m pretty sure this happens to a lot of people. I like how the algorithm suggests stuff that I like and play, but I don’t actually receive information about releases from Latin American artists, not much anyway. Can Spotify help me with this? Is there a way around it? And I don’t want the Top 50 songs per country, because unfortunately, for the purpose of variety, these lists are always populated by the same artists and kinds of songs. I’d like to be able to actually discover new artists, popular or not, indie, emergent, folk and avant-garde, and with with the tools Spotify offers right now, this is a very hard task. Thank you.',\n",

If you're using an IDE or Editor, like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc: Spotify recommends coding-related songs/playlists, like thison the main page. You can also customize genres per activity.

       " 'PlanPremium FamilyCountryCzech RepublicDeviceWindows 10 PC, iPhone 8, iPhone SE 2020Operating SystemWindows 10, iOS My Question or IssueI use Spotify to listen to music. I enjoyed some podcasts in past, but I do not really like them on my main page. If you also stop listening to them, you are still stuck with them no matter what. You listen to 1 sec of a certain podcast by accident (for fun my Girlfriend selected German The Sims 4 podcast which we do not even understand as we do not speak the language, yet now it is forever in my recommendations). I listened to the new Obama\\'s podcast for few minutes and found it not so entertaining as I do not follow US politics that much anymore, yet here we are, forever stuck with me. Spotify is like \"YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO MORE PODCASTS!!1!1!\" yet I\\'m not really interested.  Below you can see my recommendation on my Win 10 Spotify App on the main page. I see nothing but Podcasts and I have to do some scrolling to get to the music I like to listen. Why?   Here you can see the same situation on my phone. It is the same, I have to scroll down to see the music I enjoy.   Worst of all? After 5 years of using Spotify I\\'m seriously considering swapping my family account to competition as Apple Music is not forcing anything you do not like onto you (at least I started my free trial yesterday and so far so good).  I understand that Spotify acquired multiple Podcast companies and they want to profit from their investments, but pushing Podcasts that much is in my opinion anti-consumer and you might loose paying customers because of it. Yes, your userbase is huge, but MySpace and Nokia used be huge, until someone better came on the scene and did it right and people liked it.  My Solution?I have few ideas. The simplest would be to separate the Music and Podcasts again. I do not know why did you decide it is a good idea to mix those two together. If you are hardcore podcast listener you will appreciate Podcast section where you can browse according to the categories, look for news, lifestyle, tech, cars etc. Music listeners like me will have their own section again and everyone will be happy!  More hardcore solution would be to allow users to customize their Home Screen. You like something? Add it to your home screen. You do not like certain recommendations? Simply remove them. You can adjust your algorithm to adjust the recommendation based on our likes/dislikes. Also where did the dislike button go? I really enjoyed clicking certain genres or artists as dislike so it is no longer recommended to me. Nowadays I\\'m stuck with what the playlist gives me and I have to skip to next song if I do not enjoy what is playing.  Thank you for listening. If you have any advise I will be happy to talk about it. If I will stick with Spotify I\\'m seriously considering to request Spotify to delete my whole account so I can start fresh. So all the stupid recommendations are removed. But that is solving the issue.   Thank you and have a great day!',\n",

However I am not sure if it could provide me the details which I am looking for. There is also a Web API endpoint available in the Browse console to get the Recommendations based on the Seeds ( Get Recommendations Based on Seeds ) However, it takes query parameters for seed_artists, seed_genres, seed_tracks. I am unaware, on what basis Spotify takes the seed values to generate the recommendations using the API endpoint. Moreover, I am assuming that it would not provide me the recommendations for artists, radios.

Insted of that, it seems that Spotify groups them for other reasons.

Another example, if you wanna hear the Pupa Jim radio, a reggae-dub artist from france, but sings in english and has an electro-minimal style, Spotifiy brings you a weird list of french reggae music that sounds very different!

They do not really make sense to me, and I am getting frustrated with the current set up. I believe it would be very cool to offer a legacy format to the application which would make my library act more like a windows media/itunes library.

I want to reitterate that I love your service and hope to continue being a patron, but I am very frustrated personally with the few latest big patches (last 9 months or so).

Even just a vague sense of the direction/likelihood if not actual timescales or anything. And the reason I ask, is...Secondly, the removal of the thumbs down/dislike/don't show again feature, basically the negativisation arm of the recommend algorithim, I know there is already a clamour for its return and I dont want to repeat the request itself, but it was marked as a 'Good Idea' in April 2020. Does that mean they will reverse the decision to remove it? Will it come back in the sam or an altered form? So long as the play history feature is available (that has come and gone over the years, too) then the fact that some people accidentally disappear songs they actually liked, given they can very quickly check their play history, is not sufficient a reason; if people are removing songs without even listening to them, then what have they lost anyway? Plus, its ridiculous to punish the 'power users' because of others irredeemible stupidity. Essentially, you have destroyed the algorithm for me and heavy users like me. It was critical to filtering out the undesirables, because there is too much 'positive' data if you have thousands of songs 'liked', so my recommendations have got progressively worse and worse, until the genuine excitement of my midnight Monday refresh of 'Discover Weekly' - it was a true marvel to get 4-5 songs minimum that you love but could never have discovered on your own - has evaporated completely. I don't even bother with recommendations now, and I've realised how tedious and repetitive it has become.

First time posting!I am having an issue with Google Home + Spotify playing a limited selection of radio songs after playing a requested song. In the past, when I request my Google Home to play a specific song (usually a children\\'s song for my kid). It would play the song followed by a recommended \"radio playlist\" of related songs. This radio playlist covers a wide range of songs and artists and are played in random order. Lately, I\\'m instead getting a very limited range of recommended radio songs after playing the requested song. In some cases, it will recommend the SAME song on repeated endlessly. In other cases, the recommended songs are out of context (example below). I checked my Spotify app and have no other songs on queue. I have never requested to the repeated song either. Is there anyway to reset the radio recommendations so that it doesn\\'t play the same artist and limited set of songs? e.g. \"Hey Google, play jingle bells\"(plays Jingle Bells as requested)(starts playing songs by Renee & Jeremy -- none of which are Christmas music!)   2. \"Hey Google, play Alphabet Roundup by Mother Goose Club\"(plays Alphabet Roundup by Mother Goose Club)(then plays Sing A Rainbow by Nicky Steel, Pat a Cake by Claudia Jones, Yellow Submarine by Nicky Steel, and repeats the same songs on and on).',\n",

       " \"Hi spotify podcast fans,Today I had a spontaneous urge to swipe in the new episodes list.  It'd be great to have a Tinder like swiping to get a hyper good podcast episode recommendation system. \",\n",
       " 'Not sure if this is an appropriate question for the \"content\" board, but here goes. While I like much of the music recommended for me based on similar music I listen to (in the Discover section) Spotify is never recommending music based on the one artist (R.E.M.) I listen to more than any other artist. For example, I listened to Hozier one afternoon and created a playlist, and Spotify followed up by recommending several artists/albums that are \"similar to Hozier.\" That was great. Same thing happened for many other artists. Also great. But I have listened to R.E.M. multiple times -- and saved the music and created playlists -- and have gotten no recommenndations at all. Are my settings wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Many thanks community!',\n",

This has now disappeared.Can someone tell me why...? Where do I now find these personal recommendations? This was the BY FAR the best part of Spotify for me. Please help! Thanks,Kirsten',\n",
       " 'This is more of a compaint or question than an idea, but this seems to be the only way to give feedback. What is up with the \"Recommended Songs\" feature? Why won\\'t it recommend Led Zeppelin? I have a list of only their music, and not a single recommended song is from them. I have another classic rock playlist with some of their music on it, and again, no other LZ songs ever show up in \"Recommended Songs,\" regardless of how many times you refresh it. What is the deal? What other bands do you all block from the \"Recommended Songs.\"',\n",
